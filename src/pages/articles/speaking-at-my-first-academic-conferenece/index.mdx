[¡Hola Madrid! Presenting at My First Academic Conference](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/intermediality/blog/),
Intermediality Blog, University of Edinburgh, Dec 2022.

Madrid became real to me when I was sweating in my waterproof jacket in the airport shuttle, thinking of my presentation
for the upcoming SEDERI conference that would take place over the next three days — from the 5th to the 7th of October
2022 — at the cultural center ‘La Corrala’; an international conference for early career researchers co-organised by
the [Spanish and Portuguese Society for English Renaissance Studies](http://www.sederi.org/) (SEDERI) and
the [Autonomous University of Madrid](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio) (UAM).

A few months before travelling to Spain, I was taking the course ‘Global Shakespeare Across Media: Performance, Cinema,
Digital Cultures’, part of the MSc Intermediality and offered across MSc programmes at the University of Edinburgh.
I wrote an abstract based on my final essay for this course and I submitted it to the SEDERI organizing committee,
simply through the link Inma, my tutor, attached in her email when she shared the call for papers with us. With my
proposal getting accepted, I started to expect my first conference!

It’s overwhelming to think of what’s waiting for me: socializing with other researchers, speaking publicly in front of
experts in the field, getting questions that I may be unable to answer, etc — it’s too intimidating to look forward to.
To get distracted from the anxiety before setting off to Madrid, I preoccupied myself with the possibility of getting
rejected for my visa application, which would have been a perfect excuse for not attending. Thus, the trip to Madrid
was spiritually never a certain event for me, until the last day in Edinburgh when I received a lovely email from Inma,
wishing me all the best for the conference and encouraging me to approach and say hi to some of her dear colleagues in
Shakespeare studies, such as Dr Reme Perni, who was also attending the conference and who, coincidentally,
ended up chairing my panel! While Inma’s email reminded me of the imminence of the conference, I found myself in a
very familiar situation of procrastination, coming back home from my part-time job at 9 pm; my traveling backpack still
lying empty on the carpet, waiting to be packed, and there was only one slide in my presentation for the paper, with an
exquisitely styled background and an unevenly sized title. Confidently, I flew to Madrid (irony intended!). Soon after
I checked in at the venue, I found myself holding the conference package
with [the programme](http://www.sederi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Programme.pdf) in my hands.

I joined the coffee break (where I could casually talk to different people with free refreshments available) which I later found out to be my favourite part of the conference. Having enjoyed all the coffee breaks, here are some reflections:

- First and foremost, the chocolate palmier is the best, even better with almond milk.
- Second, a successful eye contact means a conversation ready to take place.
- Third, it’s natural to start the conversation with the presentation dates and paper topics after introducing ourselves to each other.
- Fourth, we were actually not very good at recognizing names or faces; we tended to recognize each other by paper topic.
- Fifth, it’s important to be a good listener.
- Lastly, if I find it awkward being silent during a conversation, it’d become like 10% less awkward if I grabbed things to eat instead.


The ideas of others were interesting enough to let me pass the first two days in a carefree excitement (as I was going
to be the last speaker to present on the third day). I even got a chance to watch a football game in person during the
first night. It was of course another kind of excitement to cheer for Real Madrid in Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

Nevertheless, I still had to spend some time every day sitting in a Starbucks to prepare my own talk for the conference.
What really motivated me to prepare was that I found the conference to be an intermedial space that would accommodate
my ideas better than my paper ever did. Writing on contemporary film adaptations, I no longer had to refer to a scene
by awkwardly describing it; rather, I could illustrate my analysis with screenshots and clips. When I was inserting
pictures, videos, and quotations with Microsoft PowerPoint, I was pleased that the slideshow — despite being a
presentation cliché — is such a great invention that’s going to give life to my ideas! Loaded with passion, I saw a
flag of Scotland in the sky on my way to the Starbucks! Fingers crossed!!

I have to confess that I skipped the morning sessions on the third day; I wandered in the museum instead at the venue.
I was crept out by these giants, badly frightened of their gazes from above. When I was about to run away, I met an
intellectual bro who was similarly skipping the morning sessions and killing time in the museum. We talked about
Catholicism, carnivals, Shakespeare, and Mikhail Bakhtin, though our knowledge only allowed for an interesting
brainstorm. Since then, I’ve started to enjoy the creepiness of those carnival giants (as a way to survive them)!

It feels great to attract attention as a speaker in the conference session, especially when I didn’t feel myself in
any way to be judged or graded. I felt rather supported and encouraged as an emergent researcher. Though I found it
hard to answer the questions in the Q&A session, they were actually very good questions that have continued to provoke
thoughts after the conference itself closed. While I had been so focused on my paper to construct a strong argument,
those question brought new dimensions and even let me see the potential of new research projects. I see the questions
as a way of support which I super appreciate (Thank you, Carlos, Yueqi, Reme, and Anna!). Also, in the first two days
I was sometimes asked a question that I hadn’t been asked for a long time, ‘Are you nervous?’ Although I wasn’t, as
long as I didn’t think of my own presentation, it was sweet that one could still talk about feelings at a conference.

Yayyyy also for those who had to leave early and couldn’t appear in this photo! The conference was exhausting. My mind
hibernated as soon as the conference finished. I really wanted to fly back to Edinburgh immediately, but I had to stay
in Madrid for another two days as I had scheduled my flight on the 9th and the conference finished on the 7th Oct.
I was tempted (by tiredness) to stay in the hostel for the next two days, but I decided to get around when I thought
of my single-entry visa — I definitely would like to make the most use of it to visit the city! Here is a photo to
prove that I did go sightseeing in Madrid:

By the way, Picasso’s Weeping Woman in the Museo Reina Sofia made my mind alive again!
